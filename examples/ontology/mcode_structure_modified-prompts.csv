Look for an explicit reference to a staging system such as FIGO (gynecologic), Binet or Rai (leukemia), Breslow Depth or Clark Level (melanoma), ISS or RISS (myeloma), INSS or INRGSS (neuroblastoma), Gleason Grade (prostate), Rhabdomyosarcoma Clinical Group, or Wilms Tumor staging."

,"Records the history of secondary neoplasms, including location(s) and the date of onset of metastases. A secondary cancer results from the spread (metastasization) of cancer from its original site.",,
,"Are there results or mentions of any tumor marker tests in the clinical notes?, answer YES or NO","The name of the clinical test or procedure performed on a patient. A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (non-cancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genomic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis.",
